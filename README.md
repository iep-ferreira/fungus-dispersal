# 🌱 Airborne Fungal Infection Simulator

## 📖 Background

Recently, a colleague reached out asking for the source code from a paper I co-authored several years ago.  
In that study, we explored how airborne fungal infections could spread in plantations mixing **susceptible** and **resistant** trees, using **cellular automata** to capture the spatio-temporal dynamics.

The full article is available in *Ecological Informatics*:

## 💾 From C to HTML/JS

The original implementation was written in **C** — and, sadly, has likely been lost to time.  
However, the algorithm itself was simple and elegant.  
This repository is an attempt to **rebuild it** in **HTML/JavaScript**.

The entire implementation was generated in a **single iteration** using the recently released **GPT-5** model — and it works! 🚀
